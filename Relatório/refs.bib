	Abstract = {Public transport users are increasingly connected in real time through mobile devices to social networks, such as Twitter and Facebook. This allows them both to access and to provide valuable operational and emotional information from and to fellow travellers. Transport network management could benefit from this exchange, and also participate by providing rewards to valuable contributors. This paper introduces a model for such cooperative exchanges of information and proposes a valuation system for the information provided and obtained. Users and automatic systems (sensors) would provide information, such as punctuality, noise levels, and assessments of driver's skills, referenced to particular vehicles, routes and times. Then other users accessing such information would classify it on the level of correctness and usefulness, under a validation scheme operated by the transport network management. Such information could either be openly available or private in some degree within a social network, taking account of security aspects that need to be preserved. In a mature environment, more valuable information could only be made available via subscription or freely available to highly valued contributing users. The use of social networks would provide an easy way of sharing information and also provide a sense of community to the involved travellers. Transport network management benefiting from relevant information exchanges could reward users contributing with valuable data, as an incentive to enhance participation. In this context, the information exchanged would achieve a real transactional value and present a new electronic commerce paradigm. Overall, such exchange could also be seen as a serious game.},

	Abstract = {Public transport industry is currently facing new challenges. Traditional payment and ticket validation systems are being replaced by others relying in new technologies like mobile devices. These allow the integration of several services such as providing real‚Äêtime information, timetables, maps, payments, and users' interaction, which enhances the overall customer experience. Furthermore, the regular suppliers of public transport like ticketing companies and ticket machines merchants are being replaced by banks and mobile operators in the public transport supply chain. This paper aims to describe the current approaches of public transport service delivery process as well as existing problems. It then summarizes the existing technologies and services that have been made available for mobile payments. Additionally, benefits of the smartphones over traditional ticketing solutions are presented, from the customers and the public transport providers' perspectives. Finally it is proposed a new payment and validation model based on location‚Äêbased ticketing provided by a mobile phone. This model intends to represent a vision of the future of travelling experience.},

@article{Mallat2007,
	Abstract = {This paper presents a qualitative study on consumer adoption of mobile payments. The findings suggest that the relative advantage of mobile payments is different from that specified in adoption theories and include independence of time and place, availability, possibilities for remote payments, and queue avoidance. Furthermore, the adoption of mobile payments was found to be dynamic, depending on certain situational factors such as a lack of other payment methods or urgency. Several other barriers to adoption were also identified, including premium pricing, complexity, a lack of critical mass, and perceived risks. The findings provide foundation for an enhanced theory on mobile payment adoption and for the practical development of mobile payment services.},

	Abstract = {This research is designed to support FTA in its efforts to disseminate knowledge of new technologies within the transit community, in this case focusing on issues associated with automated fare collection (AFC) for commuter rail. By identifying ``lessons learned'' with AFC deployments, the report is also intended as a resource for commuter railroads considering adoption of AFC and/or joining multi- modal electronic payment systems. The findings may be of particular use for commuter rail systems that are still in the planning stages and have the opportunity to leapfrog older technologies.},

	Abstract = {This report documents work performed under FTA's Advanced Public Transportation Systems (APTS) Program, a program structured to undertake research and development of innovative applications of advanced navigation, communication, information, computer, and vehicle technologies that most benefit public transportation. This report is the latest in a series of State-of-the-Art reports, the last of which was published in January 1998. It contains the results of an investigation of the extent of adoption of advanced technology in the provision of public transportation service in North America. It focused on some of the most innovative or comprehensive implementations, categorized under five types of service/technologies: Fleet Management, Traveler Information, Electronic Fare Payment, Transportation Demand Management, and Intelligent Vehicle Initiative. The objective of this effort was to increase the industry's knowledge of successful applications of advanced technologies with the expectation that this will lead to their widespread adoption.},

UITP Congress served as a forum to outline possible solutions and present exemplary projects demonstrating the metamorphosis that public transport is experiencing in every area. UITP decided to reward to best projects by/for young people, public transport's future users, and decision-makers. Innovation can be found in the restoration and modernization of existing infrastructure to integrate the latest technological advancements and improve the performance and quality of public transport. It is described during the meeting that public transport is an attractive sector for investors and donors. The congress demonstrated that political commitment, awareness raising, and educating about public transport are international level needs.},
